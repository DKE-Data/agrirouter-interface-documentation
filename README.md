## Project description

### The agrirouter

The agrirouter is a universal data exchange platform for farmers and agricultural contractors that makes it possible to connect machinery and agricultural software, regardless of vendor or manufacturer. Agrirouter does not save data; it transfers data.

As a universal data exchange platform, agrirouter fills a gap on the way to Farming 4.0. Its underlying concept unites cross-vendor and discrimination-free data transfer. You retain full control over your data. Even data exchange with service providers (e.g. agricultural contractors) and other partners is uncomplicated: Data are very rapidly transferred via the online connection, and if you wish, is intelligently connected to other datasets.

### The current project you're looking at
