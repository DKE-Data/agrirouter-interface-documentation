== Basic Concepts

Before starting with the integration, it's important to understand the link:./basic-concepts.adoc[basic concepts of agrirouter] including topics like:

=== Ecosystem

++++
<p align="center">
 <img src="./../assets/images/ig1\image10.png" width="642px" height="321px"><br>
 <i>The agrirouter ecosystem of members</i>
</p>
++++

The agrirouter ecosystem and the members of it are described in the chapter link:./ecosystem.adoc[Ecosystem].

=== Endpoints

++++
<p align="center">
 <img src="./../assets/images/ig2/image26.png" width="623px" height="268px"><br>
 <i>Architecture of an endpoint</i>
</p>
++++

The elements of an endpoint are described in the chapter link:./endpoint.adoc[Elements of an endpoint].

=== Communication
++++
<p align="center">
 <img src="./../assets/images/ig2/image31.png" width="543px" height="313px"><br>
 <i>The onion principal of communication</i>
</p>
++++

The different layers of communication between an app instance and agrirouter are described in the link:./communication.adoc[Concepts of communication]

=== Message Exchange
++++
<p align="center">
 <img src="./../assets/images/ig1\image13.png" width="634px" height="314px"><br>
 <i>Way of a message through agrirouter</i>
</p>
++++

The basic concepts of message exchanged are described in the link:./message-exchange.adoc[Concepts of Message Exchange]

This chapter handles, for example, the concepts of addressing members of the ecosystem.

=== Messaging Workflows
++++
<p align="center">
 <img src="./../assets/images/general/general_process.png" width="543px" height="313px"><br>
 <i>Messaging Workflow and lifecycle of an endpoint</i>
</p>
++++

There is a common lifecycle for an endpoint, that is described in the link:./messaging-workflow.adoc[Messaging Workflows].

=== Telemetry Platforms integration
++++
<p align="center">
<img src="./../assets/images/ig2\telemetryplatform.png" width="619px" height="366px"><br>
<i>Telemetry Platforms are cloud systems that communicate for multiple CUs</i>
</p>
++++

If your system involves communication units, that communicate to your cloud solution in a proprietary way, take a look at the link:./telemetry-platform-concepts.adoc[Concepts for Telemetry Platforms integration]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Each agrirouter account has a limited number of endpoints, see link:./limitations.adoc[here].
====

== Development Resources

There are several development resources which can be found in link:./development-resources.adoc[the list of development resources] including topics like:

* link:./keys.adoc[The keys & Certificates]
* link:https://github.com/DKE-Data/agrirouter-postman-tools[Postman collection for onboarding and Revoking]
* link:./tools/paho.adoc[Paho for MQTT Connection]
* link:./tools/arts.adoc[The agrirouter protobuf toolset]
* link:./tools/endpoint-recording.adoc[The endpoint recording]
* link:https://github.com/DKE-Data[The github Account with documentation and APIs]
* link:https://github.com/DKE-Data/agrirouter-api-developer-tutorial[A video tutorial on the integration process]

== General process of integration in QA

</p>

== 3.1 Create developer account
To start the development, you will need to link:./registration.adoc[create a developer account].

There is also a link:https://github.com/DKE-Data/agrirouter-api-developer-tutorial/blob/master/02-create-developer-account/index.adoc[Video Tutorial on creating an account]

== 3.2 Register & Submit your solution

For communication with agrirouter, you need to link:./applications.adoc[setup an application] in the Quality assurance environment.

There is also a link:https://github.com/DKE-Data/agrirouter-api-developer-tutorial/blob/master/03-create-application/index.adoc[Video Tutorial on registering applications]

== 3.3 Waiting for approval by the support team

Whenever you create a new application version, the agrirouter support team will have to approve this application. Please send an email to support@my-agrirouter.com including the application Id and the certification version ID to request confirmation. Find out where to find them link:./ids-and-definitions.adoc[here].

== 3.4 Contact certification company

Every app needs to be certified to communicate with the agrirouter. Further information can be found link:./certification.adoc[here].

Once you know, which kind of application you want to create, you should get in contact with one of the link:https://my-agrirouter.com/support/certification[certification companies] to clarify, which specific requirements you will have to fulfill to pass the certification.
This will help you to adapt your implementation for the certification and add all requirements for certification.

Make sure to have all link:./certification.adoc#Prerequists[prerequists] available.


== 3.5 Integrate interface in your solution

The following chapters describe all requirements to integrate an application with agrirouter.

=== Before we begin
First, you should always keep in mind the link:./integration/general-conventions.adoc[General conventions].

There are several environments for test and production in different areas of the world. Their different parameters like URLs and certificates can be found in the link:./integration/environments.adoc[Environments].

=== General lifecycle of an endpoint
++++
<p align="center">
 <img src="../assets/images/general/lifecycle.png"><br>
</p>
++++

=== Connecting your app instance

==== Authorization
FarmingSoftware and Telemetry Platforms have to perform an link:./integration/authorization.adoc[Authorization Process] to clarify, that the account user is known.

==== Onboarding

To communicate with the agrirouter, an application Instance needs to be link:./integration/onboarding.adoc[onboarded]. An application instance can be link:./integration/reonboarding.adoc[ReOnboarded].


=== Communicate with agrirouter endpoints

==== Building messages

To send a message, it has to be built first. Read link:./integration/build-message.adoc[here] about building messages and commands.


==== Sending messages and commands

Every application instance can link:./integration/message-sending.adoc[send messages] and commands the same way.

While link:./tmt/overview.adoc[messages] are meant to be forwarded to other endpoints, link:./commands/overview.adoc[commands] are used to link:./commands/ecosystem.adoc[explore the ecosystem], link:./commands/endpoint.adoc[configure your endpoint] and link:./commands/feed.adoc[request messages from the feed].

==== Receiving messages and command answers

Command results and messages from other endpoints will be link:./integration/message-receiving.adoc[received through the outbox] by the receiving application instance.

Messages from other endpoints are put into the outbox by link:./integration/push-notification.adoc[push notifications] as well as by link:./commands/feed.adoc[requesting the feed content].


Depending on the  link:./integration/analyze-result.adoc#ResponseType[resultType], the result can be link:./integration/analyze-result.adoc[analyzed].

=== End of life for an endpoint

When an endpoint shall be deleted, it can be link:./integration/revoke.adoc[Revoked].

== 3.6 Test Interface and messaging

In status _Approved for Testing_, application developers can link:./invite-testers.adoc[add other accounts for testing their application]. If a certification version is in status _Approved for Testing_, instances with this certification version can be onboarded in these test accounts and an external test can be started. The developers account automatically is an end user account, that is a test account. This means, that a developer can onboard an endpoint in his account.

[IMPORTANT]
====
As the application currently only communicates with the agrirouter Quality assurance environment, it cannot be onboarded in the Production environment. See link:./integration-prod.adoc[Integration in Production] for those further steps.
====


== How to proceed

Once you finished the tests and see your app ready to be published, you can proceed with the link:./integration-prod.adoc[integration in the productive environment].
