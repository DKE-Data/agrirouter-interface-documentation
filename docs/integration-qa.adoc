== Basic Concepts

Before starting with the integration, it's important to understand the link:./basic-concepts.adoc[basic concepts of agrirouter] including topics like:

* link:./ecosystem.adoc[Ecosystem]
* link:./endpoint.adoc[Elements of an endpoint]
* link:./message-exchange.adoc[Concepts of Message Exchange]
* link:./communication.adoc[Concepts of communication]
* link:./messaging-workflow.adoc[Messaging Workflows]
* link:./telemetry-platform-concepts.adoc[Concepts for Telemetry Platforms integration]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Each agrirouter account has a limited number of endpoints, see link:./limitations.adoc[here].
====

== Development Resources

There are several development resources which can be found in link:./development-resources.adoc[the list of development resources] including topics like:

* link:./keys.adoc[The keys & Certificates]
* link:https://github.com/DKE-Data/agrirouter-postman-tools[Postman collection for onboarding and Revoking]
* link:./tools/paho.adoc[Paho for MQTT Connection]
* link:./tools/arts.adoc[The agrirouter protobuf toolset]
* link:./tools/endpoint-recording.adoc[The endpoint recording]
* link:https://github.com/DKE-Data[The github Account with documentation and APIs]
* link:https://github.com/DKE-Data/agrirouter-api-developer-tutorial[A video tutorial on the integration process]

== 3.1 Create developer account
To start the development, you will need to link:./registration.adoc[create a developer account].

There is also a link:https://github.com/DKE-Data/agrirouter-api-developer-tutorial/blob/master/02-create-developer-account/index.adoc[Video Tutorial on creating an account]

== 3.2 Register & Submit your solution

For communication with agrirouter, you need to link:./applications.adoc[setup an application] in the Quality assurance environment.

There is also a link:https://github.com/DKE-Data/agrirouter-api-developer-tutorial/blob/master/03-create-application/index.adoc[Video Tutorial on registering applications]

== 3.3 Waiting approval by support team

Whenever you create a new application version, agrirouter support team will have to approve this application. Please send an email to support@my-agrirouter.com including the application Id and the certification version ID to request confirmation. Find out where to find them link:./ids-and-definitions.adoc[here].

== 3.4 Contact certification company

Every app needs to be certified to communicate with the agrirouter. Further information can be found link:./certification.adoc[here].

Once you know, which kind of application you want to create, you should get in contact with the link:https://my-agrirouter.com/support/certification[certification company] to clarify, which specific requirements you will have to fullfill to pass the certification.
This will help you to define your implementation and add all requirements for certification.

Make sure to have all link:./certification.adoc#Prerequists[prerequists] available.


== 3.5 Integrate interface in your solution

The following chapters describe all requirements to integrate an application with agrirouter.

=== Before we begin
First, you should always keep in mind the link:./integration/general-conventions.adoc[General conventions].

There are several environments for test and production in different areas of the world. They can be found in the link:./integration/environments.adoc[Environments].

Even though certification is part of the integration process for the productive environment, you should contact the link:./certification.adoc[relevant certification institut] once you have an overview of what you want to build, to check, which technical requirements for the certifications are important to concern in the development.

=== Connecting your app instance
FarmingSoftware and Telemetry Platforms have to perform an link:./integration/authorization.adoc[Authorization Process] to clarify, that the account user is known.

To communicate with the agrirouter, an application Instance needs to be link:./integration/onboarding.adoc[onboarded]. An application instance can be link:./integration/reonboarding.adoc[ReOnboarded] or all application instance of a specific customer can be link:./integration/revoke.adoc[Revoked].


=== Communicate with agrirouter endpoints

To send a message, it has to be built first. Read link:./integration/build-message.adoc[here] about building messages and commands.

Every application instance can link:./integration/message-sending.adoc[send messages] and commands the same way.

While link:./tmt/overview.adoc[messages] are meant to be forwarded to other endpoints, link:./commands/overview.adoc[commands] are used to link:./commands/ecosystem.adoc[explore the ecosystem], link:./commands/endpoint.adoc[configure your endpoint] and link:./commands/feed.adoc[request messages from the feed].

Command results and messages from other endpoints will be link:./integration/message-receiving.adoc[received through the outbox] by the receiving application instance.

Messages from other endpoints are put into the outbox by link:./integration/push-notification.adoc[push notifications] as well as by link:./commands/feed.adoc[requesting the feed content].


Depending on the  link:./integration/analyze-result.adoc#ResponseType[resultType], the result can be link:./integration/analyze-result.adoc[analyzed].

== 3.6 Test Interface and messaging

In status _Approved for Testing_, application developers can link:./invite-testers.adoc[add other accounts for testing their application]. If a certification version is in status _Approved for Testing_, instances with this certification version can be onboarded in these test accounts and an external test can be started. The developers account automatically is an end user account, that is a test account. This means, that a developer can onboard an endpoint in his account.

[IMPORTANT]
====
As the application currently only communicates with the agrirouter Quality assurance environment, it cannot be onboarded in the Production environment. See link:./integration-prod.adoc[Integration in Production] for those further steps.
====


== How to proceed

Once you finished the tests and see your app ready to be published, you can proceed with the link:./integration-prod.adoc[integration in the productive environment].
