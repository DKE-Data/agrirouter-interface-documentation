To communicate with all the other endpoints in the eco system of the specific agrirouter account, it is required to read,

* which endpoints are available
* which TMT they can send
* which TMT they can receive
* which TMT they are subscribed for

== Call for endpoints, that support a technical message type

=== Definition

Every App Instance can call for a list of endpoints, that are capable of receiving or sending specific messages. This request does not filter for available routings.

[NOTE]

* The endpoint requesting the endpoint list is also part of this answer.

* The concept of groups is only used to give a little more comfort to the end user when setting rules. It is currently not possible to address a message to the group.

[NOTE]
====
**Implementation advices**

If your application can send messages without user interaction, it is adviced to update the endpoint list in a cyclic manor, e.g. every 5 minutes.

If your application only sends messages, if a user is present, it is adviced to update the endpoint list depending on the user interaction, e.g. manually with an "update" button or integrated in another user interaction like opening the destination selection dialog.

__These are advices, not requirements__
