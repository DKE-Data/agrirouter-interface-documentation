These commands are used to control the delivery of messages from the feed to the app instance through the outbox. See also link:../endpoint.adoc[architecture of an Endpoint]

== Paging

Due to the huge number of messages, that could be delivered with a single call for messages, it would be a bad idea, to deliver all those message headers in one big package. Therefore, a paging mechanism was introduced to split the whole list of messages or message headers. into several pages, each including a maximum number of messages or a maximum overall size of the Result.

All pages will be the result of one single GET Request, if all messages are delivered to the outbox, when the endpoint requests them. If not all messages have been delivered from feed to the outbox at this point in time, the endpoint will have to poll for the messages. In MQTT, all Pages are delivered one after each other.

[NOTE]
====
If an app instance misses one package, it should first request the messages of the headers, it already received to shorten the list of headers delivered when requesting again. This only works for self containing message, it is critical, if the missed package includes parts of a chunked message.
====

== Message Query and Filtering

Reading the messages, the message headers from the feed or deleting messages from the feed can be done using a message filter including the following parameters:

[cols="1,3,2,4",options="header",]
|================================================================================
|# |Name |Type |Description
|1 |message_ids |String(repeated) |A list of agrirouter message IDs
|2 |senders |String(repeated) |A list of message senders
|3 |validity_period |Validity Period |A time span, that the messages were sent in
|================================================================================

The validity Period has following parameters.

[cols="1,3,2,4",options="header",]
|==============================================
|# |Name |Type |Description
|1 |sentFrom |Timestamp |Begin of the time span
|2 |sentTo |Timestamp |End of the time span
|==============================================

A message with id, source and timestamp fits the filter, if

* (id is part of messageIDs or messageIDs is empty) AND
* (source is part of senders or senders is empty) AND
* (timestamp is within validity_period or validity_period is empty)


== Call for Message Header List

=== Definition

To receive the Message ids of all available messages or a specific filtered list of available message IDs, an App Instance can call for the message headers available in the feed to be delivered to the Outbox

=== Command

[cols=",",]
|==============================================================
|Command |dke:feed_header_query
|Protobuf Schema |agrirouter.feed.request.MessageQuery
|TypeURL |types.agrirouter.com/agrirouter.feed.request.MessageQuery
|==============================================================

==== Parameters[[Parameters_For_header_List]]
The command can include one or more filter criteria. If one filter is not provided, this means, that this filter is ignored.

[cols="1,3,2,4",options="header",]
|=====================================================================================================================================
|# |Name |Type |Description
|1 |message_id |string |The message ID to request, delete or confirm the message
|2 |technical_message_type |string |The technical message type of the message
|3 |team_set_context_id |string |The teamset ID to assign the message to the correct context.
|4 |chunk_contextID |string |The chunk context corresponding to the chunk list
|5 |payload_size |int64 |The size of the payload
|6 |sent_timestamp |timestamp |The timestamp, that was provided by the sender. It should be the time when the message orignally was sent
|7 |sequence_number |int64 |The sequence number to determine the correct order for messages, that were recorded at the same time point
|=====================================================================================================================================

[NOTE]
====
The result is sorted ascellading by the senderID.
====

Within the sender-reciever package, the messages are sorted primary by the timestamp and secondary by the sequence number.

The header is a list of Sender+Receiver-Touples with a sublist of message headers. This sublist is sorted by the timestamp and – if multiple messages with the same timestamp exist – the Message Sequence Number.

=== Result

|===============================================
|# |Name |Type |Description
|1 |number |int32 |The index of the current page
|2 |total |int32 |The total number of pages
|===============================================

The chunk context is an Array of available chunk contexts within this messages. If there are multiple of them, this means, that there are multiple chunked messages to be realigned.

The chunk context is described in 13.2 Chunking big messages

The feed includes an array of message headers

[cols="1,3,2,4",options="header",]
|=========================================================
|# |Name |Type |Description
|1 |sender |string |Endpoint ID of the sender
|2 |receiver |string |Endpoint ID of the receiver
|3 |header |Header (repeated) |An array of message headers

[NOTE]
====
As a telemetry platform can receive messages for multiple Virtual CUs, the receiver field is used to determine the correct virtual CU.
====

=== Errors

If the message was incorrect, an ACK_WITH_FAILURE will be reported. For specific error messages, see the error list.

=== Certification Requirements
It is checked in advance, which of the 3 fields senderId, MessageId and validity Period your software supports in which combination. Those combinations will be checked and have to create valid requests, that would not create error messages from the agrirouter. For example, the list of message Ids - if used - needs a list of UUIDs, empty Strings or the endpoint names would be invalid.

=== Errors

If the message was incorrect, an ACK_WITH_FAILURE will be reported. For specific error messages, see the error list.

=== Certification Requirements
It is checked in advance, which of the 3 fields senderId, MessageId and validity Period your software supports in which combination. Those combinations will be checked and have to create valid requests, that would not create error messages from the agrirouter. For example, the list of message Ids - if used - needs a list of UUIDs, empty Strings or the endpoint names would be invalid.


=== Chunked messages

Messages sent to the agrirouter can be split into multiple chunks, if the message format is not EFDI.

 <i>Chunked messages</i>
</p>
++++


Only those message, that were not created by the agrirouter and that are not of type EFDI can be chunked.

==== Recognizing chunked messages in the feed

To recognize chunked messages, request the message header query and see, if you find different chunk contexts.

==== Pulling chunked messages from the feed

Chunked messages can be pulled like any other message type. make sure to request all chunks at once, so that you can make sure, that the message can be rebuild successfully before confirming chunks, which would delete them from the feed.

== Call for message deletion

=== Definition

An app instance can delete message from its feed, if it does not want to consume them. Therefore, it sends a list of message IDs or a validity period or a list of senders to the inbox.

=== Command

[cols=",",]
|==============================================================
|Command |dke:feed_delete
|Protobuf Schema |agrirouter.feed.request.MessageQuery
|typeURL |types.agrirouter.com/agrirouter.feed.request.MessageQuery
|==============================================================

See <<Parameters_For_header_List>> for parameters and Filtering.

=== Result

[cols=",",]
|=====================================
|ResultCode |ACK_WITH_MESSAGE
|Protobuf Schema |message
|typeURL |“agrirouter.commons.Messages”
|=====================================

In case of success, you receive VAL_000209 and a list of MessageIDs that could be confirmed.

=== Errors

If the message was incorrect, an ACK_WITH_FAILURE will be reported. For specific error messages, see link:../error-codes.adoc[the error list].


=== Certification Requirements
It is checked in advance, which of the 3 fields senderId, MessageId and validity Period your software supports in which combination. Those combinations will be checked and have to create valid requests, that would not create error messages from the agrirouter. For example, the list of message Ids - if used - needs a list of UUIDs, empty Strings or the endpoint names would be invalid.


= Controlling the outbox 

To make sure, that no message gets lost due to e.g. a loss of internet connection while delivering a message, the app instance has to confirm the receival of every message.

== Call for message list confirmation

=== Definition

Once a message was downloaded from the outbox, the Client has to confirm, that it properly received this message/those messages.

[NOTE]
====
When a message is confirmed, it will be deleted from the feed.

As long as it is not confirmed, it will be delivered in a FeedRequest or FeedHeaderRequest again, if there is no specific filter to avoid this. 
Messages shall always be confirmed to avoid Emails to customers about old messages in the endpoints feed.

The old behavior, where a message was delivered over and over again with a FeedMessageRequest, even though it was not specifically requested, was removed with the introduction of push notifications.
