== In General

Every application needs to be certified to communicate with the agrirouter. The certification ensures, that the communication protocol of the agrirouter is successfully implemented and the application can communicate correctly with the agrirouter.

A certification is needed any time the application changes its capabilities or their sending directions, changes the commands or uses a different protocol to communicate with the agrirouter.

[NOTE]
=====
For a new certification version capabilities can never be removed. Neither can a sending direction of a capability be removed. It is only allowed to add capabilities or sending directions for a new version to ensure downwards compatibility. The capabilities command however can of course only include a subset which is smaller than in the version before.
=====

== Out of focus

The certification will not check if an application is able to work with the data sent over the agrirouter. The process will only check, if the application can send and receive data for the technical message types which were selected for the certification version earlier on.

== Certification companies

There are multiple certification companies, a list can be found link:https://my-agrirouter.com/support/certification/[here].

== Certification Requirements

To pass the certification tests there are multiple requirements have to be fulfilled before the certification can start.

=== Prerequisites

* The link:./provider-agreement.adoc[DKE application provider agreement] has to be signed.
* The link:./marketplace.adoc[marketplace entry] has to be created with a "Coming soon" label.
* The following information about the company is available:
** Name
** Address (where billing and offer should be placed by the certification company)
* The following first level customer support information is available:
** Mail
** Address
** Phone
** URL

=== Additional requirements during the process

The following information is not required to start the certification but will be required before finishing it:

* A link:./registration.adoc[production environment developer account of the application provider]
* The application Id and certification version Id of link:./applications.adoc[an application in the production environment].
* Version, name and description of the application to certify.
* Message protocol of the application (MQTT / REST).
* Message format of the application (JSON / Native Protobuf).
* The capabilities of the application including link:./tmt/overview.adoc[the technical message types] and  sending directions.
* A list of link:./commands/overview.adoc[all commands], that are used by the application.
* Is this an initial certification or a recertification for a new version of an existing software?
* For some test case there has to be at least one extracted original message (as JSON or Base64-Encoded native Protobuf) provided to the certification company.

== Certification timeout

Once the certification is started, it needs to be successfully passed within 10 weeks. Otherwise, additional costs could be incurred. It is important to respect this time range as part of the implementation planning. 


== Certification tests
Not all of the certification tests are necessary for your implementation. The certification company is able to tell you which of the tests are necessary to full fill all requirements.

[NOTE]
====
The term __"All TMTs"__ on this page means "All Technical Message Types, that were reported in the application certification version".
====

The selection depends on several parameters and attributes of the specific application. These parameters are listed in the following chapters

=== Based on the application type

Based on the type of your application, different tests are required. Check link:./applications.adoc[here], which type of application suites your requirements best.

|====


=== Other requirements
[cols="1,3,3",options="header",]
|====
|Topic |Description |Expected results / Acceptance criteria
|Timestamps
a| It will be tested, that the software uses UTC Timestamp for every message it sends. See also the link:./integration/general-conventions.adoc[general conventions].
a|
* It's checked if sent messages are in a range of +/- 1 minute of UTC.

|Id requirements
| There are several general requirements on counters and Ids communicated to agrirouter.
a|
* Every application message Id has to be a UUId.
* On every start up, the sequence number needs to start at 1 and has to be incremented with every command / message.
* The link:./integration/general-conventions.adoc#string-identifiers-convention[external Id requirements] will be checked.

|Billing requirements
| To avoid problems during the invoicing and billing process, there are some requirements to support the whole process.
a|
* The application should save the `accountId` provided during the onboarding process. The account ID is part of the billing / invoicing and can used to check the invoice, therefore, it should be saved.

| Account management
|If supported, it is checked if the application / communication unit correctly changes the agrirouter endpoint used for the communication when changing the account internally.
a|
* After creating a new account / user in the application to be certified, the test steps have to be repeated with the new account.
* Differentiation between different accounts exists.
* No messages are sent to a wrong account.

|Teamset reports
|The application to be certified needs to report teamsets and provide unique teamset Ids.
a|

* A change of the machine configuration (adding a machine) leads to a new machine in the agrirouter UI.
* A change of the machine configuration (removing a machine) leads to a new teamset context Id.
* A change of the machine configuration (changing a device description) leads to a new teamset context Id

|Clean your feed
a|Make sure, your feed will be cleaned by confirming or deleting messages after receiving them.
[REMARK]
====
For the certification, the rule of cleaning your feed applies with a shorter period of time to clean it, just by practical reasons of the certification. Please check the specific time periods with your certification company.
====
a|
* After the several tests of receiving or rejecting messages, it will be checked if the feed is empty.
* All messages are removed from the feed of the endpoint (either be deleting or receiving and confirming) within a certain period of time.

|Valid commands
|The application to be certified has to show that it can build and send all commands relevant for its implementation without producing an ACK_WITH_FAILURE at agrirouter mentioning an invalid message.
a|

* All relevant all commands for the implementation can be built and sent without producing an ACK_WITH_FAILURE at agrirouter mentioning an invalid message

| Error handling
a| All errors that show up during communication with agrirouter need to be documented by the application to be certified.

a|
* Application have to document or display, if any error occurs in communication with agrirouter. In particular:
** agrirouter system messages
** agrirouter validation messages

* The application provider can show an error message received from agrirouter to the certification company. This can be an administration functionality (e.g. log or UI).
* Error messages shown to an end user should include the error code and a self-defined message of the application provider (not just the SAP error message).

| Buffering
| If the Internet connection gets lost or agrirouter is not available for another reason, the application instance should buffer data, that needs to be sent, when the connection is reestablished.

The application instance needs to check for reconnection on its own.
a|
* It's checked, if an application instance keeps trying to communicate with agrirouter, when it's not available.
* It is checked, if an application instance of an application to be certified will retry to send a dataset, that should have been sent, when the agrirouter was offline. This applies for EFDI as well as for every other technical message type

| Test coverage for Telemetry platform
a| For Telemetry platform, it will be checked in advance of the test, which functionalities are required for the platform itself and which functionalities are required for its Virtual CUs.

Telemetry platform must at least support the onboarding and offboarding of VCUs as well as the secured onboarding and authorization.

Tests are setup depending on the capabilities of the telemetry platform itself and its VCUs.

a|
* All requirements described above need to work with 2 different VCUs and - if sending and/or receiving is supported by the platform itself - by the Telemetry platform.

| Base64 Encoding
a| Base64 Encoded strings shall *not* include line breaks. 
a| Neither Base64 encoded files nor the Base64-encoded messages may include line breaks
|====

=== Message protocol layer and message format

If your software supports REST or MQTT with JSON, sending and receiving of those formats is checked.

If your software supports REST with native Protobuf, sending and receiving of those formats is checked.

==== For HTTP REST

[cols="1,3,3",options="header",]
|====
|Topic |Description |Expected results / Acceptance criteria
|Polling |It is checked, that your application does not flood agrirouter with polls |The application shall not poll the outbox of each app instance more often than described link:./messaging-workflow.adoc#request-sending-frequency[here].
|====

== Recertification cases

An application has to be re-certified, if one of the following things apply:

* A new technical message type and/or direction is supported by your application
* The basic message protocol (MQTT or REST) has changed
* The basic message format (JSON or native Protobuf) has changed
* The list of implemented commands changed
* Push notifications are activated in the capabilities

[IMPORTANT]
====
The supported TMTs as well as the used protocol and format are assigned to the certification. A change of any of those functionalities will cause an invalidity of the certificate, which will block your applications communication to agrirouter.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
In the unlikely event of an update of agrirouter software, which requires changes in the app providers software (e.g. a new error code, that shall be handled), a new certification is *not required*. However, the app provider is responsible for keeping his software up to date.
