== 2.3 Select "coming soon" label

If your app is not directly certified, select the "coming soon" label to mark, that it is not yet available for end customers.

After certification is finalized, the app provider may remove the "coming soon". 

== 2.4 Approve from support team

Whenever you change your marketplace entry, the agrirouter support team will review your changes before they become visible in the public marketplace entry. This is done to avoid changes in the capabilities of your software without recertification. This check only applies to the capabilities and the communication interface with agrirouter, not the overall functions of your software/hardware.
