== Ecosystem

The agrirouter ecosystem and the members of it are described in the chapter xref:./ecosystem.adoc[ecosystem].

.The agrirouter ecosystem of members

== Applications and App Instances

In each agrirouter account, there are different types of communication partners, which are called app instances:
.The different types of app instances: CU, Application, Virtual CU, Machine, Account
image::ig1/image11.png[The different types of app instances: CU, Application, Virtual CU, Machine, Account]


The list of xref:./ecosystem.adoc#applications[Application Types] helps to find out, which type of application you should create.

== Endpoints
Each app instance communicates with its corresponding endpoint in the agrirouter.

For communication, it's important to understand the xref:./endpoint.adoc[elements of an endpoint].

.The elements of an endpoint: Communicate with Inbox and Outbox, Handle Feed and Subscriptions and send Messages through the routings to other endpoints

== Communication
 
To communicate with agrirouter, it's important to understand the xref:./communication.adoc[basics of communication]

=== Messaging Workflow

The communication workflow describes, which messages have to be send to agrirouter to exchange information with the agrirouter endpoint. 

.General messaging workflow

This workflow can be found in the chapter xref:.//messaging-workflow.adoc[messaging workflows].

=== Message Exchange

The message exchange describes the exchange of messages between application instances over the agrirouter.

.Way of a message through agrirouter
image::ig1/image13.png[Way of a message through agrirouter,634,314]


The basic concepts of message exchange are described in the xref:./message-exchange.adoc[concepts of message exchange].
This chapter handles, for example, the concepts of addressing members of the ecosystem.



== Life cycle 
In general, the life cycle of an endpoint consists of 3 steps:

* xref:./integration/onboarding.adoc[Onboarding]
* Communication (see above)
* xref:./integration/revoke.adoc[Offboarding/Revoking]

.The 3 steps of communication: Onboarding, Communication, Revoking

== Concept of a telemetry platform

When developing a telemetry platform, the xref:./telemetry-platform-concepts.adoc[concepts of a telemetry platform] should be understood.

== Terms and short descriptions

A short description naming all the agrirouter specific terms and their connection to each other can be found xref:./terms.adoc[here].

A list of abbreviations can be found xref:./abbreviations.adoc[here].

A glossary can be found xref:./glossary.adoc[here].

There are several ids required for communication, a list of descriptions can be found xref:./ids-and-definitions.adoc[here].
