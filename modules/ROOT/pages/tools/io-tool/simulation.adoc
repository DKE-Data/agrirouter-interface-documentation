The simulation feature of IO-Tool allows you to simulate a machine working on the farm for your farming software. To do this, you need telemetry data from a machine and your IO-Tool account.

* Simply go to the _Simulation_ tab and select a source file. 

* You will then have the option to select the time logs. A TLG is created when a machine is switched on, starts working in the field and is terminated when the machine is paused or switched off.

* The _Skip Initial_ field allows you to skip any data at the beginning of the file that you don't want simulated.

* The _Intervall_ field allows you to specify how often (in seconds) data should be sent to the agrirouter.

* The _Scale_ function can be used to speed up the simulation.

* If the _Endless Loop_ box is ticked, the data will be run over and over again in an endless loop.

* You can adjust the time of the telemetry data using the _Replace Time_ function (e.g. live data).

Now you can export the data and it will be converted to the telemetry data format (EFDI). Use the _Show DDI_ button to see exactly what data is being transferred (such as fuel consumption, etc.). https://www.isobus.net/isobus/dDEntity[Here] are the keys to the numerical codes to be found.

To start the simulation, click on the green play button. 
Once the simulation has started, it can be paused or forwarded using the buttons below:

The first message sent to the agrirouter is the description of the machine. As soon as this message is sent, a new endpoint is created in the agrirouter account (this may take a few seconds).
