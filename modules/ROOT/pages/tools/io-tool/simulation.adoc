:imagesdir:

The simulation feature of IO-Tool allows you to simulate a machine working on the farm for your farming software. To do this, you need telemetry data (e.g. a TaskData ISOXML
) from a machine and your IO-Tool account.

* Simply go to the _Simulation_ tab and select a source file. (all the ISOXML and EFDI data from Data Storage) 

* You will then have the option to select the time logs (TLG) . A TLG is created when a machine is switched on, starts working in the field and is terminated when the task is paused or the machine is switched off. If you select all, all TLGs will be played one after another.


* The _Skip Initial_ field allows you to skip any data at the beginning of the file that you don't want simulated. A common use case could be missing GPS information in the beginning of the simulation.


* The _Intervall_ field allows you to specify how often (in seconds) data should be sent to the agrirouter.

* The _Scale_ function can be used to speed up the simulation.

* If the _Endless Loop_ box is ticked, the data will be simulated over and over again.


* You can adjust the time of the simulated data using the _Replace Time_ function (e.g. live data).

You can export the data using the _Export_ button and it will be converted to the telemetry data format (EFDI). 

Use the _Show DDI_ button to see exactly what data is being transferred (such as fuel consumption, etc.). https://www.isobus.net/isobus/dDEntity[In isobus.net] are the keys to the numerical codes to be found.

To start the simulation, click on the green play button. 
Once the simulation has started, it can be paused, forwarded to the next TLG or stopped using the buttons below:

The first message sent to the agrirouter is the description of the machine. As soon as this message is sent, a new endpoint is created in the agrirouter account . 


[NOTE]
====
When sending data for a machine for the first time, may take a few seconds to create machine and routings in agrirouter. During this time, errors with the simulation may show up in the Logging. This is normal behavior and not critical.
====

As soon as the agrirouter has received this information, a new endpoint will be created for the machine. Once the agrirouter has created the new endpoint, the data is forwarded to all relevant endpoints (is published) .

== Receiving Telemtry Data

To see, how it looks like when Telemetry data is received, check the xref:tools/io-tool/mapview.adoc[MapView].
