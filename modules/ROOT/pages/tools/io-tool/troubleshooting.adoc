This section describes some common error scenarios and a systematic approach to resolving them.


== Common Upload Errors

Here's a list of common errors when uploading files. Please note that all these errors and tests come from the IO-Tool and that the agrirouter itself does not check data consistency.

=== Corrupt stream

=== Unknown file type

A file with a valid zip structure is sent, but does not contain a TaskData.xml (this is the main file of an ISOXML DataSet) can be successfully sent but not received. 

When trying to receive, no error is displayed and nothing is downloaded. 

When uploading such file, the file format is unknown.

=== Upload warnings

It is possible, that the upload is successful, but you receive a few warnings (for proprietary elements in this example).

An upload warning is received when uploading a dataset includes 2 valid ISOXMLs; one in the root folder, one in the subfolder.

[NOTE]
====
It is in general not wrong to have multiple taskSets in one zip file, but for compatibility reasons you should avoid this.

== Error when receiving data

Sometimes errors can occur when receiving data. In the agrirouter endpoint view tab  "Details" you can check how many messages are still to be received for the specific endpoint:
