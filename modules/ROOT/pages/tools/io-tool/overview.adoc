== What's this about?

The IO-Tool is the most feature-complete tool to test your integration with agrirouter.

It is *not* an end user software and it is *not* equal to the agrirouter.

The IO-Tool can be used as an example communication partner for your agrirouter implementation.

The agrirouter InOut-Tool is a tool to simulate a remote endpoint and to learn to communicate via agrirouter.

Using the IO-Tool you can 

* exchange data
* send and receive telemetry data
* set preferences for the data exchange
* check the logs and debug
* simulate end points and set routings

Where to find: https://io.my-agrirouter.com/

== Getting Started
The tool does not have self-service registration, please send an email to request an account (support@my-agrirouter.com).

Here is an email template for you

_Dear Sir/Madam,_

_My name is (first name, last name) from (company) and I would like to request an IO-Tool account for the email address (your email). In case of any questions please reach out to (contact person)._

_Thank you in advance._

You will then be emailed your login details and can enter them in this view to log in.

The main page of the IO-Tool is then displayed with the three menu sections 

* Data Storage
* Logging
* Settings

If you only see these three, it means that you are *not* yet connected to the agrirouter.

The screen is divided into several sections. The left panel displays the main menu and the centre panel presents the main content of the page. The bottom section contains the logs of all actions, which can be expanded.




== Getting Ready for Data Exchange

To be able to use the IO-Tool for data exchange, you need to connect the IO-Tool to an agrirouter account. To do this, just follow xref:tools/io-tool/onoffboarding.adoc[the onboarding steps]

After being successfully connected to the agrirouter account you will have two new sections in your main menu (Endpoints & Simulation) and more advanced settings.

== Data Storage

This view allows you to select the data you intend to transfer.

You can either upload files from your device or select from the list of previously uploaded files. You can also send files to the IO-Tool via the agrirouter. The system will 
automatically select the file type, which can be manually adjusted later. Files are grouped by type in expandable sections.



== Logging

The Logging section of the Main Menu provides more detailed information about the actions performed.

== Let's get started

In the following chapters you will find all details for work with the IO-Tool.


== Registration and Onboarding

In this chapter, we'll get you an IO-Tool account and onboard the IO-Tool to agrirouter. See here


== Settings 

The settings of the IO-Tool change the behavior of the tool at the agrirouter. See here


== Logging 

We'll describe where and how you find and read the logs of your IO-Tool instance. See here


== Endpoint List

Who's visible for the IO-Tool in my agrirouter account and how to check that. See here

== FileList

Exchange files with other agrirouter Endpoints. Understand how to up- and download, send, receive and manipulate files. See here

== Overview

== Send Files 


== Change Files 


== Receive Files 


== EFDI Telemetry Viewer


== Simulation

Trying to implement a telemetry view in your solution? Use the IO-Tool Simulator to play any ISOXML Files telemetry data.
