== Endpoints

To be able to send data you need to have *endpoints*. The endpoints are the representation of the farmer's software components in the agrirouter account that your IO-Tool account is connected to. Such components are e.g. a terminal, which is a communication unit (CU), or a farm management system, which is a farming software.
In order to exchange data, you must therefore have at least one second IO-Tool account connected to the same agrirouter account. To connect it, just repeat the onboarding steps.

Once you have connected your second IO-Tool account to the *same* agrirouter account, you will need to switch to the agrirouter to set routes.

In the control center of your agrirouter account, you will see the following screen, where you can click on the plus sign to activate a new route.

After clicking on the plus sign you can select the recipient from the list (in this case you would select your second IO-Tool account).

You also have the choice of which message formats you would like to allow.

Follow the same steps for the "Receive From" tab to add a sender.
If you now go back to your IO-Tool and reconnect MQTT in the settings, a new endpoint will be added.
