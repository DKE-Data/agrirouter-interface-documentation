== Format

The zip file data has to be transferred in a Base64 representation of its binary data. If the (base64 encoded) file size exceeds the maximum size of a message, it has to be chunked. Each chunk needs to be a valid base64 string, which requires base64 encoding **after** splitting the binary data into chunks.

[NOTE]
====
The base64-encoding of the binary chunk/file data is not the same as the base64 encoding of the message. It is an additional step!
