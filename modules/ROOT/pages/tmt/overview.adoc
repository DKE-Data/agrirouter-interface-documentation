== General

Technical message types are several standardized formats that agrirouter apps should be capable of reading and creating. 
These are the messages that are exchanged between application instances **over** the agrirouter.

These technical message types are summarized into information types for the end user to make it easier for him to create the routings based on the type of data and not on the format of it.

In addition to the technical message types listed here, further technical message types can be added in agrirouter. However, only message formats that have a high significance and acceptance in the industry and are therefore helpful for the exchange of agricultural data are added.

The available technical message types can be found in the agrirouter UI when creating a new application and setting the capabilities:
