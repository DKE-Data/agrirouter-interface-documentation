Only the public key will be stored in the agrirouter, the private key has to be stored by your app in a secure way.

== Endpoint certificate

The endpoint certificate is used to encrypt the communication with the agrirouter. It is delivered with the onboarding request.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The certificate you receive during xref:integration/onboarding.adoc[onboarding] is valid for a certain period. This period has been 1 year in the past, but will soon (July/August 2022) be increased to 10 years.

After that, you have to perform the xref:integration/reonboarding.adoc[re-onboarding].

**Be aware** that this will require user interaction.

If your are using MQTT Router Devices, you only have to renew the Router Devices' certificates centrally because the endpoints' certificates are not used in that case.
