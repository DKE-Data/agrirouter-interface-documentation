== General Overview


=== Standard behaviour
The normal behaviour of agrirouter is to put incoming messages from other endpoints to the feed of the receiving endpoint(1).

The app instance can send a request for messages to its endpoint (2), agrirouter will search for messages in the feed(3), so that they are forwarded to the outbox(4), where they can be requested from (REST) or will directly be delivered (MQTT)(5).

Received messages need to be confirmed (6) to delete the message from the feed (7).

=== Push Notifications
With push notifications activated, a copy of each message sent to the feed(1) is directly copied to the outbox(2) and delivered to the app instance (directly via MQTT or through polling using HTTP)(3).  Pushed messages need to be confirmed(4) as well as requested messages to be deleted from the feed (5).

[NOTE]
====
Messages in the outbox persist for a short time (for CUs, you can assume 2 hours, for MQTT its up to 3 days). If an app instance was not connected to agrirouter for a while, the messages will be deleted from the outbox, however, they persist in the message feed.


Every app instance should therefore check its feed in a periodic manner.
For HTTP REST clients, this should be at least every 4 hours, for MQTT clients, this should be done at least every 3 days.
====

Push notifications can be activated through the xref:../commands/endpoint.adoc#capabilities[Capabilities command].


=== Analyse Push Messages
A push message will be received directly through the outbox without any command sent to the inbox.

[cols=",",]
|=====
|ResultCode |PUSH_NOTIFICATION
|Protobuf Schema |agrirouter.feed.push.notification.proto
|TypeURL |types.agrirouter/agrirouter.feed.push.notification
|=====

The push message element includes
[cols="1,3,2,4",options="header",]
|=====
|# |Name |Type |Description
|1 |messages| [FeedMessage] | An array of FeedMessages
|=====

[NOTE]
=====
For the first release, the push message array will always include only one entry. If multiple messages shall be delivered,
multiple Push notifications are delivered; each including one message.

However, make sure that you check the possible multiple FeedMessages delivered with foreach functionalities to be future proof
=====


Each message includes a header and a payload:
[cols="1,1,1,4",options="header",]
|=====
|# |Name |Type |Description
|1 |header |Header |The header of the message
|2 |content|Any | An "Any"-Object including the payload
|=====


The header includes the basic information about the message and equals the message headers received from the xref:./../commands/feed.adoc[feed].

[cols="1,3,2,4",options="header",]
|=====================================================================================================================================
|# |Name |Type |Description
|1 |receiver_id |string |The ID of the receiver of the message. This can be the app itself, an attached machine or a Virtual CU
|2 |technical_message_type |string |The technical message type of the message
|3 |team_set_context_id |string |The teamset ID to assign the message to the correct context.
|4 |chunk_context |agrirouter.commons.ChunkComponent |The chunk component
|5 |payload_size |int64 |The size of the payload
|6 |sent_timestamp |timestamp |The timestamp that was provided by the sender. It should be the recording time point
|7 |sequence_number |int64 |The sequence number to determine the correct order for messages that were recorded at the same time point
|8 |sender_id |string |The endpoint ID of the sender
|9 |created_at |Timestamp |The timestamp, when this message was added to the receiving endpoints feed
|10 | message_id |String | Internal agrirouter message ID representing this message and its payload
|11 | metadata | agrirouter.commons.Metadata| Additional metadata information to help differentiate between messages of the same type 
|=====================================================================================================================================

[NOTE]
====
In case of a chunked message, the meta information will always be available in every single message.
====

[NOTE]
=====
There is no paging mechanism available in Push notifications
All messages will be delivered in responses with a maximum size of 1 MB. So, as long as you receive push notifications, you should keep on polling if there are more of them.

=====

==== Metadata
From Release 1.2 of the agrirouter, messages can be extended by metadata to provide further information.

The metadata field includes the following fields:

[cols="1,3,2,4",options="header",]
|=====================================================================================================================================
|# |Name |Type |Description
|1 |file_name |string |The corresponding file name of the sent file; relevant e.g. if multiple TaskDataSets are sent.
|=====================================================================================================================================


=== Delivery Order
While messages from the feed are delivered "in order", messages directly pushed might be unsorted; chunked file messages could for example "overtake" each other on the way from Endpoint1 to Endpoint2.
