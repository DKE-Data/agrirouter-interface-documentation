= Authorization Process
:imagesdir: 


== What is this process used for?

The authorization process was designed to give application providers of applications the chance to make sure, they know, which account is assigned to which agrirouter account. Otherwise, fake accounts could consume data on their costs.

[NOTE]
====
As the authorization process – in difference to the rest of the communication – provides a request to your agrirouter integration and not the response to a request from your agrirouter integration, the documentation of the parameters is done in a little different way and there is no description for a HTTP Response code, because we don’t get one.
====


The authorization process is required for farming software and telemetry platforms, for CUs it is an optional function.

For CUs, this requires additional infrastructure, therefore DKE advises to use the registration code exchange process.

== Authorization of farming software

The application provider should make sure that only such agrirouter accounts can onboard one of his applications that he can assign to one of his users.

[NOTE]
====
As the user has to log on to agrirouter, the authorization process requires a browser UI!
====

=== Preparation

To provide authorization, the developer first has to setup the application.

In the developers' UI, he has to:

* Copy the application ID (1)
* Call Edit (2)
* Provide a redirect URL, to which agrirouter shall deliver the authorization result using HTTP 301 Browser redirect.(3)
* Provide a public key for his encryption or create a key pair on the agrirouter frontend

[NOTE]
====
During development, if your application is not yet reachable publicly or you are developing for a desktop application, you can just use http://127.0.0.1, plus any port number (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:12080).

=== Authorization Process Overview

The authentication process works as follows:

.Authorization Workflow
[plantuml,authorization_workflow,svg]
----

|Application Backend|
start
:Create and send\nauthorization link;
|Browser|
:User clicks on link;
:Call agrirouter link;
|agrirouter Backend|
:Provides a website\nfor authorization;
|Browser|
:Display website;
if (User clicks\n"Accept") then (Yes)
    |agrirouter Backend|
    :Provides URL encoding result;
else (No)
    |agrirouter Backend|
    -[#red]->
    #tomato:Provides URL encoding error;
    -[#red]->
endif
|Browser|
:Calls redirect URL\nand forwards\ninformation;
|Application Backend|
:Handles result;

end

----

To better understand what happens here, try the following:

1.  Call https://httpbin.org/get in your browser. You’ll get a JSON view of the get request
2.  Call https://httpbin.org/get?Param1=Value1&Param2=Value2 in your browser. You’ll get a view of the get request

* https://httpbin.org simply echoes the request that is sent to the page. That’s important to understand

[NOTE]
====
* For testing purpose, you can just enter the url https://httpbin.org/get in your applications redirect URL (see below) to see the result of authorization.

* The step "user clicks on Link" might not be needed, applications could handle that different.
For example the application could send a redirect (HTTP Status 300) to directly redirect the user to the agrirouter Connection Website. The description "user clicks on Link" is simply the most understandable description we could come up with.
====


=== Generating an authorization URL

The base URL can be found xref:urls.adoc#AuthorizationURLs[here].

The authorization Link is a HTTP GET Request that has to be called from a browser.

[cols="1,4",options="header",]
|===============================================
|Method |Address
|GET |/application/{\{applicationID}}/authorize
|===============================================

To provide a link for authorization, create a link like this:

**__{\{agrirouter-url}}/application/{\{applicationID}}/authorize?{\{response_type}}&{\{state}}&{\{redirect_uri}}__**

[cols="2,3,3",options="header",]
|=====================================================================================
|Parameter |Example Value |Remark
|{\{agrirouter-url}} |see above |Differentiates between QA and Live system
|{\{applicationID}} |Noted from the agrirouter UI |
|{\{response_type}} |response_type=onboard a|
Possible values:

verify: only verify the user,

onboard: verify user and create a Registration Code (Token)

|{\{state}} |state=w4st556dr543d4wr4s4 a|
A number to identify the request result on server side. The provided Number should be:

* Unique
* Not guessable

|{\{redirect_uri}} | |Could extend your entered redirect URL. The base redirect URL needs to be configured by the application developer in the UI. If this query parameter is omitted, the configured URL will be used. This parameter can override the configured URL as long as the configured URL is a substring of the one defined in the request (e.g. configured: example.com/callback | query parameter: example.com/callback/customer15). 
|=====================================================================================

[CAUTION]
====
Calling this link will deliver a website to log in to agrirouter, therefore, this link has to be called through a browser!
====

[NOTE]
====
The response type onboard can be used to onboard farming applications without having to create a Registration Code in the agrirouter UI.
====

=== Perform authorization

When the user clicks on the link, the agrirouter website is called. If the user is currently not logged in, he has to log in. After logging in, he is delivered a website to authorize the connection between agrirouter and the application provider:

.Application authorization screen
image::ig2/image14.png[Application authorization screen,333,303]


=== Analyse result

agrirouter sends an HTTP 301 redirect to the browser, encoding the authorization result in a GET queue attached to the Redirect URL entered in the developers' application settings.

The browser reacts in requesting this redirect URL which performs a GET request at the endpoint of the address.

The following parameters will be delivered in the GET-Query:

[cols="1,2,2,4",options="header",]
|============================================================================================================
|Position |Name |Type |Description
|1 |signature |String |A base64 encoded signature to verify that the source of the message is the agrirouter
|2 |state |String |The value that was passed to the agrirouter in parameter State
|3 |token |String |A base64 encoded JSON Object as Result
|(3) |error |String |If error is delivered, user declined connection!
|============================================================================================================

.Example of an authorization result
image::ig2/image15.png[Example of an authorization result]


==== Checking for errors

If the result includes a parameter *error*, the request was declined. Possible values:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===============================================
|Value |Description
|request_declined |The user clicked on "decline"
|===============================================

==== Checking authenticity

Before analyzing the result, which is encoded in the *token*, it should be made sure that the result (provided to the browser and from there to the application provider's server) is really provided by the agrirouter.

Steps:

 * concatenate `state` and `token` from the query
 * create the SHA256 hash of the concatenated string
 * verify the authenticity of the `signature` with the **agrirouter public key** and generated hash

[CAUTION]
====
Make sure you **do not** use the public key you got when you created your application in agrirouter!

You **have to** use the key from xref:../keys.adoc[Certificates and keys]!
====

[NOTE]
====
* Many implementations of the verification algorithm directly include the SHA256 hashing. If you have to provide the algorithm SHA256 to your verification library call, it's fairly possible that you do NOT have to create a SHA256 hash before and can directly provide the concated strings of state and token.
* Don't forget to url decode `state` and `token` before concatenation. 
* The `signature` is base64 encoded binary, you need to decode it before using.
====


==== Analyse the result in token

The result token is a base64 encoded JSON object including the following parameters:

[cols="1,1,3",options="header",]
|=======================================================================================================================================================
|Name |Type |Description
|account |String |The unique id of the user account on agrirouter that will be provided to you in the metrics exports for billing
|regcode |String |If `response-type=onboard`, this regcode will deliver a Registration Code equal to clicking the RegistrationCode when clicking the `+ Telemetry` button and select a CU in the agrirouter ui
|expires |DataTime |The date and time (in UTC) when the regcode becomes invalid
|=======================================================================================================================================================

IMPORTANT: The account ID is used for invoicing. Therefore it should be saved with the onboarding reponse together, so the check of the invoice is possible. If the account ID is missing comparing the items on the invoice is not possible, since the invoicing is based on the account ID.

**EXAMPLE**
[source,json]
----
{
    "account": "31c83d5d-c307-42f9-80b1-6fc9324823b8",
    "regcode": "f75bfbd41b",
    "expires": "2018-02-27T10:49:04.901Z"
}
----

== Authorization for CUs and non-cloud-software

To perform authorization for software that is not provided as a cloud solution, a small cloud onboarding service could be created to handle the onboarding communication:

.Authorization for non-cloud-applications
image::ig1/image27.png[Authorization for non-cloud-applications,640,155]


[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure, you save all the information returned from the authorization request, as you will e.g. need the account id for the xref:integration/revoke.adoc[Revoke functionality]!
