== Connecting your app instance

=== Authorization
Farming Software and Telemetry Platforms have to perform an xref:../integration/authorization.adoc[Authorization Process] to clarify that the account user is known.

=== Onboarding

To communicate with the agrirouter, an application Instance needs to be xref:../integration/onboarding.adoc[onboarded]. An application instance can be xref:../integration/reonboarding.adoc[Re-onboarded].


== Communicate with agrirouter endpoints

=== Building messages

To send a message, it has to be built first. Read xref:../integration/build-message.adoc[here] about building messages and commands.

List of possible message content:

* xref:../commands/overview.adoc[Commands to interact with the agrirouter]
* xref:../tmt/overview.adoc[Technical message types to exchange data between endpoints of the agrirouter]

=== Sending messages and commands

Every application instance can xref:../integration/message-sending.adoc[send messages] and commands the same way.

While xref:../tmt/overview.adoc[messages] are meant to be forwarded to other endpoints, xref:../commands/overview.adoc[commands] are used to xref:../commands/ecosystem.adoc[explore the ecosystem], xref:../commands/endpoint.adoc[configure your endpoint] and xref:../commands/feed.adoc[request messages from the feed].

=== Receiving messages and command answers

Command results and messages from other endpoints will be xref:../integration/message-receiving.adoc[received through the outbox] by the receiving application instance.

Messages from other endpoints are put into the outbox by xref:../integration/push-notification.adoc[push notifications] as well as by xref:../commands/feed.adoc[requesting the feed content].

=== Analysing messages

Depending on the  xref:../integration/analyse-result.adoc#ResponseType[resultType], the result can be xref:../integration/analyse-result.adoc[analysed].

== End of life for an endpoint

When an endpoint shall be deleted, it can be xref:../integration/revoke.adoc[Revoked].
