= 3. Interface Integration in Quality Assurance
:imagesdir: _images/

== Before we begin

Before starting with the integration, it's important to understand the xref:../basic-concepts.adoc[basic concepts of agrirouter]. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Each agrirouter account has a limited number of endpoints, see xref:../limitations.adoc[here].
====

== Development Resources

There are several development resources which can be found in xref:../development-resources.adoc[the list of development resources] including topics like:

* xref:../keys.adoc[The keys & Certificates]
* link:https://github.com/DKE-Data/agrirouter-postman-tools[Postman collection for onboarding and Revoking]
* xref:../tools/paho.adoc[Paho for MQTT Connection]
* xref:../tools/arts.adoc[The agrirouter protobuf toolset]
* link:https://github.com/DKE-Data[The github Account with documentation and APIs]
* link:https://github.com/DKE-Data/agrirouter-api-developer-tutorial[A video tutorial on the integration process]

== General process of integration in QA
image::general/process_integration_qa_v2.png[]



== 3.1 Create developer account
To start the development, you will need to xref:../registration.adoc[create a developer account].

There is also a link:https://github.com/DKE-Data/agrirouter-api-developer-tutorial/blob/master/02-create-developer-account/index.adoc[Video Tutorial on creating an account]

== 3.2 Register & Submit your solution

For communication with agrirouter, you need to xref:../applications.adoc[setup an application] in the Quality assurance environment.

There is also a link:https://github.com/DKE-Data/agrirouter-api-developer-tutorial/blob/master/03-create-application/index.adoc[Video Tutorial on registering applications]

== 3.3 Waiting for approval by the support team

Whenever you create a new application version, the agrirouter support team will have to approve this application. Please send an email to support@my-agrirouter.com including the application Id and the certification version ID to request confirmation. Find out where to find them xref:../ids-and-definitions.adoc[here].

== 3.4 Contact certification company

Every app needs to be certified to communicate with the agrirouter. Further information can be found xref:../certification.adoc[here].

Once you know, which kind of application you want to create, you should get in contact with one of the link:https://my-agrirouter.com/support/certification[certification companies] to clarify, which specific requirements you will have to fulfil to pass the certification.
This will help you to adapt your implementation for the certification and add all requirements for certification.

Make sure to have all xref:../certification.adoc#Prerequists[prerequists] available.


== 3.5 Integrate interface in your solution

The following chapters describe all requirements to integrate an application with agrirouter.

=== Before we begin
First, you should always keep in mind the xref:../integration/general-conventions.adoc[General conventions].

There are several environments for test and production in different areas of the world. Their different parameters like URLs and certificates can be found in the xref:../integration/environments.adoc[Environments].

=== General lifecycle of an endpoint
image::graphs/lifecycle.svg[]

=== Connecting your app instance

==== Authorization
Farming Software and Telemetry Platforms have to perform an xref:../integration/authorization.adoc[Authorization Process] to clarify that the account user is known.

==== Onboarding

To communicate with the agrirouter, an application Instance needs to be xref:../integration/onboarding.adoc[onboarded]. An application instance can be xref:../integration/reonboarding.adoc[Re-onboarded].


=== Communicate with agrirouter endpoints

==== Building messages

To send a message, it has to be built first. Read xref:../integration/build-message.adoc[here] about building messages and commands.

List of possible message content:

* xref:../commands/overview.adoc[Commands to interact with the agrirouter]
* xref:../tmt/overview.adoc[Technical message types to exchange data between endpoints of the agrirouter]

==== Sending messages and commands

Every application instance can xref:../integration/message-sending.adoc[send messages] and commands the same way.

While xref:../tmt/overview.adoc[messages] are meant to be forwarded to other endpoints, xref:../commands/overview.adoc[commands] are used to xref:../commands/ecosystem.adoc[explore the ecosystem], xref:../commands/endpoint.adoc[configure your endpoint] and xref:../commands/feed.adoc[request messages from the feed].

==== Receiving messages and command answers

Command results and messages from other endpoints will be xref:../integration/message-receiving.adoc[received through the outbox] by the receiving application instance.

Messages from other endpoints are put into the outbox by xref:../integration/push-notification.adoc[push notifications] as well as by xref:../commands/feed.adoc[requesting the feed content].

==== Analysing messages

Depending on the  xref:../integration/analyse-result.adoc#ResponseType[resultType], the result can be xref:../integration/analyse-result.adoc[analysed].

=== End of life for an endpoint

When an endpoint shall be deleted, it can be xref:../integration/revoke.adoc[Revoked].

== 3.6 Test Interface and messaging

In status _Approved for Testing_, application developers can xref:../invite-testers.adoc[add other accounts for testing their application]. If a certification version is in status _Approved for Testing_, instances with this certification version can be onboarded in these test accounts and an external test can be started. The developers account automatically is an end-user account that is a test account. This means that a developer can onboard an endpoint in his account.

[IMPORTANT]
====
As the application currently only communicates with the agrirouter Quality assurance environment, it cannot be onboarded in the Production environment. See xref:../partner-process/integration-prod.adoc[Integration in Production] for those further steps.
====


== How to proceed

Once you finished the tests and see your app ready to be published, you can proceed with the xref:../partner-process/integration-prod.adoc[integration in the productive environment].
