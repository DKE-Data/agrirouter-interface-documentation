= Read the eco system
:imagesdir: 



To communicate with all the other endpoints in the eco system of the specific agrirouter account, it is required to read,

* which endpoints are available
* which TMT they can send
* which TMT they can receive
* which TMT they are subscribed for

== Call for endpoints that support a technical message type

=== Definition

Every App Instance can call for a list of endpoints that are capable of receiving or sending specific messages.
This command only takes into account *capabilities* of endpoints, but does not take into account any routes.

A complete list of endpoints in the connected agrirouter account is returned.
Only the `message_types` list will be filtered according to the parameters.

=== Command

|2 |direction |Direction | The direction *the remote endpoint* supports (e.g. "Can *the remote endpoint* SEND this message type?")
|================================================================================================

The direction describes if messages shall be sendable or receivable:

The endpoint response includes a list of available endpoints:

[cols="1,3,2,4",options="header",]
|====================================================================================
|# |Name |Type |Description
|1 |endpoint_id |String |The endpoint ID to address a message to
|2 |endpoint_name |String |The name of the endpoint as displayed in the agrirouter UI
|3 |endpoint_type |String |The type of Endpoint, see below
|4 |status |String |The current activity status of the endpoint
|5 |message_types |MessageTypes |See below
|6 |external_id |String |The id provided as "id" in the onboarding request
|====================================================================================

The endpoint Type can be one of the following Values:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|==========================================================================================================
|Code |Description |Comment
|application |Software Application |Software Application
|foreignMachine |External Machine |Machine shared by a paired agrirouter account
|machine |Machine |Agricultural machine
|messageRecordingReplay |Recording Player |Can replay recorded messages
|pairedAccount |Paired Account |Represents a paired agrirouter account with which you can exchange messages
|endpointGroup |Group |A group of other assets (applications, machines) with common rules
|virtualCU |Telemetry Platform |Connection via Telemetry Platform
|==========================================================================================================

The status can be one of the following values:

[cols="",options="header",]
|========
|Status
|active
|inactive

The Message object describes technical message type and direction.

|# |Name |Type |Description
|1 |technical_message_type |String |The technical message type *the remote endpoint* supports
|2 |direction |Direction | The direction *the remote endpoint* supports (e.g. "Can *the remote endpoint* SEND this message type?")
|================================================================================================


The direction describes if messages shall be sendable or receivable:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===================
|Nr |Direction
|0 |Send
|1 |Receive
|2 |Send and Receive
|===================

[NOTE]
====
* The endpoint requesting the endpoint list is also part of this answer.

* The concept of groups is only used to give a little more comfort to the end user when setting rules. It is currently not possible to address a message to the group.
====

[NOTE]
====
**Implementation advises**

If your application can send messages without user interaction, it is advised to update the endpoint list in a cyclic manor, e.g. every 5 minutes.

If your application only sends messages if a user is present, it is advised to update the endpoint list depending on the user interaction, e.g. manually with an "update" button or integrated in another user interaction like opening the destination selection dialog.

__These are advises, not requirements__

=== Errors

If the message was incorrect, an ACK_WITH_FAILURE will be reported. For specific error messages, see the error list.


== Call for filtered list of endpoints that support a specific message type

This request is used for request a list of endpoints that support a technical message type and has corresponding routings to the requesting endpoint.

This command takes into account the *routes* between endpoints, which implicitly includes capabilities.
