= Global Message Codes
The below listing of messages are those which will be used as output within the ACK* messages pushed to connected endpoints of the agrirouter.

[NOTE]
====
Error messages should never be shown 1:1 to the user, they should always at least be extended by an application specific message.
====

== Message Placeholders
With the messages we will have place holders for values which would be injected into the message text at runtime. Within the output response of the ACK message we would also have an args section. The args section will contain an object map of key value pairs for the data injected into the message. The following list defines these keys so that it clear what should be used.

[width="100%",options="header"]

| Place Holder           | Key              | Value        
| %endpointId%           | endpointId       | The ID of the endpoint. Depending on the message this could be a sender or a recipient                            
| %externalId%           | externalId       | The ID provided by the external application to identify the endpoint                                              
| %reason%               | reason           | In some cases we would propagate a message from another system like IoT CF                                        
| %technicalMessageType% | technicalMsgType | The ID of the technical message type                  

| %machineId%            | machineId        | The clientName provided within the device description (Also would be the ExternalID from the agrirouter Endpoint) 
| %attributeName%        | attributeName    | The name of a field within a message. Typically used in scenarios where field validations are failing             
| %messageId%            | messageId        | An agrirouter message ID                                                  
| %teamSetContextId%     | teamSetContextId | The ID of the teamset context provided
| %deviceId%     | deviceId | Machine Device ID from the device description message
