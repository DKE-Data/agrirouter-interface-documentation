== General Password policies
Passwords have a minimum length of 8 characters.
They do not expire.

After 5 failed logons, the account will be locked for 1 hour.


== End-User (Farmers, Contractors, Consultants)
 
The end-user has access to the graphical user interface of the agrirouter for end users.

The user interface offers possibilities to handle the account:

* onboard new application instances (creating endpoints in their agrirouter account)
* create groups of endpoints
* connect an account with other agrirouter accounts to exchange data
* setup routings to allow or disallow message delivery to specific endpoints or endpoint groups
* view a list of news/updates for his account (e.g "account connected", "endpoint onboarded", etc.)

A specific help for handling of an end user account can be found link:https://ad.my-agrirouter.com[in the agrirouter Academy].


== Developers

A developer account has all the features of an end-user account.

[NOTE]
====
There is only *one* developer account needed *per company*. Testing the app can and should be done from ordinary end user accounts.
====

Additionally, developers can manage their own applications:

* Create new applications
* Modify the information of the application like name, description or icon
* Add new software versions for certification
* Manage the required capabilities of the application
* Block specific endpoints, e.g. to avoid abuse of applications
* Export metrics of agrirouter usage for billing and statistical purposes
